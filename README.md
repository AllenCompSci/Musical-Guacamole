$experimented with drawing and moving polygons 

## Week 2 

@experimented using different decibel values with master gain in audioInputStream to change volume of sound.

$more shapes and moving https://mathbits.com/MathBits/Java/Graphics/GraphingMethods.htm 

$moving based on the players movements

@was able to have music play at the same time as graphics in the driver using John's src and putting in audioInputStream

$experimented and researched moving objects and hitboxes http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19629257/java-moving-an-object-across-the-screen and http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/100531-how-to-create-a-circle-eclipse-that-will-move/
